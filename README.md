# Weather-Box
This is a practice of front-end coding practice.
The main part of this work is a weather box with some animations in it.
It is coded with HTML and Sass.

For some guide on using it:
1. Move mouse into the upper area(blue background), then it will automatically show the weather from Monday to Sunday.
2. Click on any place within the whole area, then the moon and the cloud will gradually fade away while the temperature being showed.
